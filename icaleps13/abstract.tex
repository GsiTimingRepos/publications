\begin{abstract}
 A new timing system based on White Rabbit (WR) is being developed for the
 upcoming FAIR facility at GSI, in collaboration with CERN, other institutes and
 industry partners. The timing system is responsible for the synchronization of
 nodes with nanosecond accuracy and distribution of timing messages, which
 allows for real-time control of the accelerator equipment. WR is a fully
 deterministic Ethernet-based network for general data transfer and
 synchronization, which is based on Synchronous Ethernet and PTP. The ongoing
 development at GSI aims for a miniature timing system, which is part of a
 control system of a proton source, that will be used at one of the accelerators
 at FAIR. Such a timing system consists of a Data Master generating timing
 messages, which are forwarded by a WR switch to a handful of timing receiver.
 The next step is an enhancement of the robustness, reliability and scalability
 of the system. These features will be integrated in the forthcoming CRYRING
 control system in GSI. CRYRING serves as a prototype and testing ground for the
 final control system for FAIR. The contribution presents the overall design and
 status of the timing system development.
