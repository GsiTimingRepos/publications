\section{CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK}

\textit{write conclusion}

A new general machine timing system for FAIR is presently being developed in
iteration cycles, where iteration provides a functional timing system
focusing in certain aspect of the final timing system. 
The next iterations  will implement timing system  for the source of the FAIR proton linac, 
followed by the CRYRING at GSI. The replacement of the existing timing 
system at the SIS18 and the ESR combined with addressing scalability will 
pave the way to the timing system for the FAIR facility.
