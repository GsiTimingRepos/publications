\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This paper demonstrates that the WR hardware and mechanism can be used 
successfully in a TC. The measurements point out a slightly better performance
of the WR TCs in terms of standard deviation of the PPS skew, 
and despite the large delays introduced by the software during the forwarding of 
the SYNC packets, the synchronization is highly stable. 

Altogether, the WR Peer-to-Peer TCs are suitable for timing systems with 
demanding requirements in terms of reliability, in addition to the
sub-nanosecond synchronization. Therefore the test presented in the paper will
be carried out again with the correct calibration values. In addition, 
the author has already begun to study the synchronization resilience of systems 
based on TCs and lower layer protocols for recovering from network failures.
