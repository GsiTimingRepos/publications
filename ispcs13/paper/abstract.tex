White Rabbit (WR) is a fully deterministic Ethernet-based network for general data
transfer and synchronization, which is based on Synchronous Ethernet, clock
loopback phase measurement and PTP. Currently the synchronization of the clocks
throughout the network is achieved using WR Switches, two-step Boundary Clocks
(BC). This paper describes a White Rabbit Transparent Clock (TC) and shows 
the performance of a prototype implementation.
